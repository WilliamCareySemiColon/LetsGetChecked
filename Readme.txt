The sample console C# solution provided in the zipped folder takes in four strings as command line arguements. 
The format of the command line is in the following format:

1) The directiory to search for the file

2) The folder inside the passed directory to store the converted file

3) The input file

4) The output file.

The directory can be relative or fixed but must be passed in through the command line. The folder which the 
files are to stored must exist for the program to work. For the purpose of the test files used, the folder 
"finalSolution" was created. The different manual test cases used for the application

The different four line arguements which have been tested are below:

"support_engineer_assessment_files/" "finalSolution/" "implement_user-centric_paradigms.csv" "test.csv"

"support_engineer_assessment_files/" "finalSolution/" "benchmark_seamless_infrastructures.csv" "test2.csv"

"support_engineer_assessment_files/" "finalSolution/" "deliver_dot-com_niches.csv" "test3.csv"

"support_engineer_assessment_files/" "finalSolution/" "e-enable_visionary_web-readiness.csv" "test4.csv"

"support_engineer_assessment_files/" "finalSolution/" "engage rich interfaces.csv" "test5.csv"

"support_engineer_assessment_files/" "finalSolution/" "engineer_frictionless_partnerships.csv" "test6.csv".

Of which 50% pass the marks as the error being thrown is out of index array notation. After reviewing the layout,
the only difference seems to be either langauge other the english used or missing/corrupted data inside the csv.
